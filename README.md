# Neural Network with Keras
This is an example of tutorial neural network using Keras and Guild AI

### Installation
First, you need to clone this repository first, then install the requirements by using this comment.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To help me for manage my experiment results, [Guild AI](https://guild.ai)

This documentation will be updated soon. For now, i think you can learn the understand the code slowly from the main.py.
All flow is define there. Goodluck!
